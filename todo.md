---

## Notes & Considerations

### Why This Order?
1. **Monitoring first:** Can't manage what you can't measure
2. **SSO early:** Prevents auth sprawl as you add services
3. **Governance before scale:** Unity Catalog prevents data chaos
4. **ML after analytics:** Show value with dashboards, then add predictions
5. **Demos last:** Need solid foundation before showing customers

### Potential Risks
- **Complexity:** This is a LOT of moving parts. Prioritize ruthlessly.
- **Maintenance overhead:** Budget 20-30% time for ops/support as platform grows
- **Customer readiness:** Manufacturing may be slow to adopt cloud/modern tech
- **Competition:** Databricks, Snowflake have head start - emphasize customization and domain expertise

### When to Pivot
- If demo users aren't engaging → simplify onboarding
- If customers push back on price → offer usage-based pricing
- If one vertical responds better → focus there
- If on-prem is required → plan for Rancher/K3s packaging

---

## Questions to Answer

- [ ] What's your budget for infrastructure costs? (AWS/GCP/Azure spend)
- [ ] How much time can you dedicate? (full-time vs. side project)
- [ ] Do you have any customer leads already?
- [ ] Preference for cloud provider? (AWS, GCP, Azure, or multi-cloud)
- [ ] On-prem requirement? (some manufacturing customers may require it)
- [ ] Geographic target? (US, EU, global?)

---

**Next Steps:**
1. Review and prioritize this roadmap
2. Start with Week 1 (Prometheus + Grafana + Loki)
3. Set up weekly check-ins to track progress
4. Adjust timeline based on your available bandwidth

Good luck building your manufacturing data platform! 🚀
